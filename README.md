# How to Create your Visual Talk
- Create [Transcript.md](https://github.com/saurabhdaware/visconf-example/blob/master/Transcript.md) file and write your transcript (You can use [Transcript Markdown](#transcript-markdown)) 
- Convert your slides to **PDF** file
- Upload `slides.pdf` and `transcript.md` to CDN (even GitHub Repository works)
- Visit https://visconf.netlify.com/create and fill a form 
(You can checkout https://github.com/saurabhdaware/visconf-example for example)

# Transcript Markdown
In transcript you can use characters like `|`, `||` and `$wait5s`.

- Single dash (`|`) will switch the text in bubble.
- Double dash (`||`) changes to next slide. 
- `$wait2s`, `$wait5s`, and `$wait10s` can be used to make a pause while talking for 2sec, 5sec, and 10sec respectively.

Example Transcript:
```md
Hey There!
| I am Saurabh, and today I am super excited to announce VisConf!!

|| A lot of times in meetups, I see talks on some amazing topics
| Sadly small meetups do not have resources to record and publish these talks
| However the world needs to see them $wait2s

|| So randomly I had the idea of creating an animated version of these talks
| VisConf lets you generate an animated version of talk from transcript and slides
| All you have to do is upload transcript and slides.pdf and send Pull Request to main repository

```
