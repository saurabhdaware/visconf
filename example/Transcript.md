Hey There!
| I am Saurabh, and today I am super excited to announce VisConf!! $wait10s

|| A lot of times in meetups, I see talks on some amazing topics
| Sadly small meetups do not have resources to record and publish these talks
| However the world needs to see them $wait2s

|| So randomly I had the idea of creating an animated version of these talks
| VisConf lets you generate an animated version of talk from transcript and slides
| All you have to do is upload transcript and slides.pdf and paste links in visconf.netlify.com/create

|| Lets discuss this in details

|| To create your own virtual talk, visit visconf.netlify.com/create or click on "Create your talk" button below
| First, you will have to create transcript.md file
| Let's see the slides first $wait10s
| As shown in the slides, single vertical slash will switch to next text bubble
| double vertical slash will change to next slide
| $ wait 2s, 5s, or 10s will make a pause while talking for respective time.

||Once you have your transcript.md ready, convert your slides to .pdf format
| Upload slides.pdf and transcript.md to CDN or a Github Repository
| As you can see in the slides, I have created a Github Repository with these files. $wait5s
| You can checkout example on github/saurabhdaware/visconf-example

|| Next, as mentioned earlier, visit visconf.netlify.com/create 
| or click on this "Create your talk" button below
| This link will take you to a form where you have to enter transcript and slides link...
| ...Event name, and you can customize your character $wait5s


|| And that's it! your talk will be visible on visconf.netlify.com/username/title-slug $wait2s
| Thank You! You can drop questions on my twitter. Bye!
