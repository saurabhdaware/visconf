Hey There!
| I am Saurabh, and today I am super excited to announce VisConf!!

|| A lot of times in meetups, I see talks on some amazing topics
| Sadly small meetups do not have resources to record and publish these talks
| However the world needs to see them $wait2s

|| So randomly I had the idea of creating an animated version of these talks
| VisConf lets you generate an animated version of talk from transcript and slides
| All you have to do is upload transcript and slides.pdf and send Pull Request to main repository

|| Lets discuss this in details

|| To create your own virtual talk, all you have to do is, edit talks.json file in src folder of my Github Repo
| First, Upload slides.pdf and transcript.md to CDN or a Github Repository
| As you can see in the slides, I have created a Github Repository with these files. $wait5s

|| Next, take fork of VisConf's GitHub Repository
| Then you can clone and edit src/talks.json
| As shown in the slides, I've added my talk configurations in talks.json $wait5s
| The configurations should be added to the node `:github-username/:talk-slug`
| If you want to test your talk locally, you can add your slides and transcript to 'public/example/'
| More information about testing presentation locally is written in GitHub's Readme

|| Send a Pull Request and you're done! $wait10s

|| Thank You! You can drop questions on my twitter. Bye!
