Hey everyone! Welcome to VisConf's NotConf Conference
| Today I will talk about how you can write and test your transcripts locally.
| Currently, to test your transcript locally, you have to run the project on your machine
| Lets see how we can do it.

|| To run the project locally, you have to take clone of the github repository.
| Then cd to the project and run npm install to install dependencies.
| start project locally using npm run dev $wait5s

|| Now you'll have visconf running on localhost:5000
| The project has 'example/' directory which includes slides.pdf and transcript.md
| The current slides that you are viewing and the transcript come from that directory.
| You can edit files in 'example/' and the changes will be reflected on localhost:5000/me/test $wait5s

|| In transcript, you can write characters as shown in slides. $wait10s
| Single vertical dash will change the text like
| this
| you 
| can
| change text with single dash
| dollar wait 2s, dollar wait 5s and dollar wait 10s will make the talk pause like this $wait10s

|| Here's an example of a transcript $wait10s
| $wait10s

|| You can also see live example on the link shown
| The GitHub link has the transcript and slides and the talk is live on the 2nd link $wait5s
