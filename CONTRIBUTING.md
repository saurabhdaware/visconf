# Contribution Help

## Setting up project locally
- Fork the repository with Fork button on top right
- git clone your forked copy with `git clone https://github.com/{your username}/visconf`
### For Frontend
- `cd visconf` 
- `npm run install` to install dependencies
- `npm run dev` to run local environment 
- Visit https://localhost:5000
*Note: PrettyURLs dont work in dev environment so you'll have to type .html extension to some pages*

### For Backend
- `npm i -g netlify-cli` to install netlify cli
- `netlify dev` to run dev environment 
- The functions would be active on `https://localhost:34567/routes/`
